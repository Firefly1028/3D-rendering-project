# 3D Rendering Project - Inspired by Daniel Shiffman aka The Coding Train
Me attempting to convert The Coding Train's 3D rendering live stream to Python (and now p5.js).

There are two main branches of this project. The default branch is the JavaScript version. Running this version will open the application in the browser using the index.html file included with it.

The second branch is the Python/Pyxel version. Pyxel is a new Python library mostly used for making retro games, but I've decided to use it with this project. It's interesting seeing a retro cube in 3D if you ask me. It turned out to be a cool choice for the application, but there are a few libraries you need to download first.
The first library you'll need is Pyxel. You can get this by using the following command:
pip3 install --upgrade pyxel

Next, you'll need numpy. To get this, enter the following:
pip3 install --upgrade numpy

It's good to run these commands even if you have previously installed these in order to get the latest version of the library possible.

And that's it. You're ready to install this if you want to for whatever reason. My goal of this project was to learn and I certainly achieved that goal.
